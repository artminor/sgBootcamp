<!--
Make the site responsive using Bootstrap's grid system.
The front page content should stack as well.
Add a Carousel that rotates with three pieces of information:
We're opening a new location!
We're rolling out our seasonal menu, with special options for this season.
The Drink of the Month is SG Special Brew.
Make sure that users who have JavaScript disabled know that this site is best viewed with JavaScript enabled.
Your header and footer must match across the pages, so store their styles in an external file called restaurantStyles.css.
Apply all positioning CSS styles for the image on the home page as an inline style.
Apply all styles for the menu and contact form in internal style sheets.
Set the background of the home page's content - not including the header, footer, or site navigation - to a color other than white.
Set the form labels for the required fields to be bold.
Style the site navigation so that:

When you hover over a link, the text is bold. This should only be when hovering. Otherwise, the text should be the normal thickness.

checked
Add a section to the menu for beverages, with a table like the one below.
Style this table to match your site's look and feel.
Active links should not be underlined.
Visited links appear in a different color than their default state.
The menu items should stack well, with no overlapping.
Give the menu background a color other than white.
Make sure that the menu item names are larger than their descriptions.
Use a jumbotron or page header to call out big news - your restaurant is opening a new location!
Style the restaurant name with a hosted or embedded font. -->
