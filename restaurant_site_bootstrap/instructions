Apply all positioning CSS styles for the image on the home page as an inline style.
Apply all styles for the menu and contact form in internal style sheets.

Make sure that the menu item names are larger than their descriptions.
Give the menu background a color other than white.
Set the background of the home page's content - not including the header, footer, or site navigation - to a color other than white.
Set the form labels for the required fields to be bold.

Visited links appear in a different color than their default state.

Active links should not be underlined.
Add a section to the menu for beverages, with a table like the one below.
Style this table to match your site's look and feel.
